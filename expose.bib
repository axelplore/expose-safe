   abstract = {Inspired by burgeoning scholarly interest in the role of digitalization in the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic is driving or constraining the digitalization of businesses around the globe. We contend that COVID‐19 is “the great accelerator” in fast-tracking the existing global trend towards embracing modern emerging technologies ushering in transformations in lifestyle, work patterns, and business strategies. Thus, COVID-19 has evolved to be a kind of “catalyst” for the adoption and increasing use of digitalization in work organization and the office, alongside presenting foreseen and unforeseen opportunities, challenges, and costs—leading to negative and positive feedback loops. In this article, we develop and advance a conceptual model by linking the different forces for and against digitalization in response to the pandemic. Our analysis indicates that adoption of emerging technologies may be hindered by vested external interests, nostalgia, and employer opportunism, as well as negative effects on employee well-being that undermine productivity, work–life balance, and future of work. Whilst digitalization may bring new opportunities, the process imparts risks that may be hard to mitigate or prepare for. Finally, we draw out the wider theoretical and practical implications of our analysis.},

The new index has attracted a lot of attention in the scientific community. The claim that the h index in a single number provides a good representation of the scientific lifetime achievement of a scientist as well as the (supposed) simple calculation of the h index using common literature databases lead to the danger of improper use of the index. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of the h index and summarize the studies on the convergent validity of this index.

GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks.

   abstract = {Recently, traditional manufacturing industries have faced two serious gaps and problems in line with effective product-line sales forecasting methods to balance the negative impacts on the performance of the subjective experience, including (1) arbitrary judgment, such as growth rate of expectancy, manager’s experiences, and historical sales data, may cause inaccurately predictive results and severe negative effects, and (2) sales forecasting is a key priority and challenge in the context of considerable product lines that have different properties and need specific models for supporting decision analytics. This study is motivated to propose an advanced hybrid model to utilize the advantages of variation for methods of fuzzy time series (FTS), exponential smoothing (ES), moving average (MA), and regression analysis (RA). To analyze the four product lines—stably growing product (SGP), declining product (DP), irregularly growing product (IGP), and special sales product (SSP)—this study is based on empirical sales data from a leading traditional manufacturer to accurately identify the high potentials of decisive key factors and objectively evaluate the model. Two evaluation standards—the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), a parameter sensitivity analysis, and comparative analysis—are measured. After implementing the data from the case study, four key reports were conclusively identified. (1) Purely for the RMSE, the best one (10.32) is the ES method in the SGP line. (2) In the DP line, the better one is the RA(2) method, with a relatively low MAPE of 17.78% and RMSE of 26.46. (3) The FTS method is the best choice (MAPE 12.41% and RMSE 18.98) for the IGP line. (4) For the SSP line, the better one (MAPE 24.05 and RMSE 29.34) is the MA method. According to the above reports, although the proposed hybrid model has a general performance for the SSP line, it still has a superior predictor when compared to manager subjective prediction. Interestingly, the proposed model is rarely used, has a new trial with an innovative solution for the traditional manufacturer, and thus realizes applicable values. The study concludes with acceptable and satisfactory results and yields seven important findings and three managerial implications that significantly contribute to decision-making reference for complete sales-production planning for interested parties. Thus, this study benefits and values a conventional industry upgrade from novel application techniques.},

Germany announced the Industry 4.0 strategy in 2013. The US government launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) in 2011 and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) in 2014. Most recently, the Manufacturing USA initiative was officially rolled out to further “leverage existing resources.. to nurture manufacturing innovation and accelerate commercialization” by fostering close collaboration between industry, academia, and government partners. In 2015, the Chinese government officially published a 10-year plan and roadmap toward manufacturing: Made in China 2025. In all these national initiatives, the core technology development and implementation is in the area of advanced manufacturing systems. A new manufacturing paradigm is emerging, which can be characterized by two unique features: integrated manufacturing and intelligent manufacturing. This trend is in line with the progress of industrial revolutions, in which higher efficiency in production systems is being continuously pursued. To this end, 10 major technologies can be identified for the new manufacturing paradigm. This paper describes the rationales and needs for integrated and intelligent manufacturing (i2M) systems. Related technologies from different fields are also described. In particular, key technological enablers, such as the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and cloud computing are discussed. Challenges are addressed with applications that are based on commercially available platforms such as General Electric (GE)’s Predix and PTC's ThingWorx.},

This paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of AI and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a widespread adoption of AI. It argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low skilled. At the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from AI-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. For this, skills policies are necessary but not sufficient. In addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy, and help share the benefits of productivity growth through the combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation, and a reduction in working time. The paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from AI, provided that policymakers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account.},

Therefore, the introduction of intelligent robotic systems in this industry may contribute to automate and improve the manual production steps, such us polishing, cleaning, packaging, and visual inspection. Due to the high complexity of the manual tasks in shoe production, cooperative robotic systems (which can work in collaboration with humans) are required. Thus, the focus of the robot lays on grasping, collision detection, and avoidance, as well as on considering the human intervention to supervise the work being performed. For this research, the robot has been equipped with a Kinect camera and a wrist force/ torque sensor so that it is able to detect human interaction and the dynamic environment in order to modify the robot’s behavior. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach, this work presents the experimental results obtained for two actual platforms, which are located at different research laboratories, that share similarities in their morphology, sensor equipment and actuation system.},

   abstract = {Forecasting is predicting or estimating a future event or trend. Supply chains have been constantly growing in most countries ever since the industrial revolution of the 18th century. As the competitiveness between supply chains intensifies day by day, companies are shifting their focus to predictive analytics techniques to minimize costs and boost productivity and profits. Excessive inventory (overstock) and stock outs are very significant issues for suppliers. Excessive inventory levels can lead to loss of revenue because the company's capital is tied up in excess inventory. Excess inventory can also lead to increased storage, insurance costs and labor as well as lower and degraded quality based on the nature of the product. Shortages or out of stock can lead to lost sales and a decline in customer contentment and loyalty to the store. If clients are unable to find the right products on the shelves, they may switch to another vendor or purchase alternative items. Demand forecasting is valuable for planning, scheduling and improving the coordination of all supply chain activities. This paper discusses the use of neural networks for seasonal time series forecasting. Our objective is to evaluate the contribution of the correct choice of the transfer function by proposing a new form of the transfer function to improve the quality of the forecast.},

From a value co-creation perspective and following a service-dominant logic, this study aims to identify essential value types that are created collaboratively by B2B professionals (namely suppliers, customers and AI providers), and critical capabilities that contribute to their value co-creation practices. Nineteen in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with three groups of B2B stakeholders in six companies that involved in an industrial AI development and usage project. The data was then analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The results of this research contain a categorisation of four value types and three sets of capabilities, together with the interrelationships between them. This study contributes to the literature of value co-creation, information system and B2B marketing by bridging these three disciplines within the context of industrial AI development and usage.},

   abstract = {The popularity of a fashion item depends on its color, shape, texture, and price. For different items (with all attributes identical except color) of a specific product, fashion retailers need to learn consumer color preference and decide their order quantities accordingly to match their products to consumer demand. This study aims to predict consumer color preference using the knowledge learned from merchandise images, historical retail data, and fashion trends. In our work, merchandise images are analyzed to extract color features, and the retail data of a sportswear retailer are used to reveal consumer choices among items with various colors. Choice behavior is described by a multinomial logit model, whose utility function captures the relationship between color features and popularity. Both linear functions and neural networks are applied to represent the utility function, and their out-of-sample prediction performances are compared. According to the out-of-sample performance test, our model shows reasonable predictive power and can outperform order decisions made by fashion buyers.},

   abstract = {With the wide variety of shapes and styles of high heels available, women are usually confronted with a plethora of physical issues, such as hallux valgus, fatigued muscles, and ankle, knee, and hip pain from wearing the wrong type of high heels for extended periods of time. In order to decrease the damage done by wearing high heels while improving comfort and support for the feet, design criteria and two special insoles were created, and these were compared to a generic type insole. Fifteen young Taiwanese women participated in the experiment, which utilized an F-scan in-shoe pressure sensor device along with video footage recording to collect data. Series analyses following the distributive and geographical clues were conducted to identify the effect of the insoles and the biomechanical explanation of the deformation of big toes. The findings prove that the designed insoles effectively reduce the deformative torque on big toes. Besides, we identified the change in the wearing condition in the test group of new insoles. Surprisingly, instead of the sagittal, the frontal offset is the actual cause of the big toe's deformation. Also, our result suggests that self-reported evaluation may not be strong evidence to measure the big toes' deformative danger. Finally, we reflect on the potential of design-centered research for theoretical construction.},

   abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) not only represents a scientific breakthrough but also has impacts on human society and economies, as well as on the development of economics. This paper focuses on the macroeconomic perspective, reviewing recent literature in order to answer three key questions. First, what approaches are being used to represent AI in economic models? Second, will AI technology have an impact on the economy different from that of previous new technologies? Third, in which aspects will AI have an impact, and what is the empirical evidence for these effects of AI?. On the first question, our review reveals that the incorporation of AI into economic models raises fundamental questions on economics and economic models. On the second question, while most empirical studies cannot deny the existence of the Solow Paradox for AI technology, some studies find that AI would have a different and broader impact than previous technologies. On the third question, studies on the labor market seem to suggest a stylized fact regarding the impact of AI on employment on different levels, and income inequality across skill levels and between developing and developed countries. The impacts of AI on international trade and education have been largely neglected and are worth further research in the future. It is also important for both theoretical and empirical studies to have a clear and accurate definition of AI so that the results are not misinterpreted.},

Nowadays, the business activities/processes have been raised and all are directly associated with industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 acts as a go-between for improved supply chain efficiency and more traditional forms of logistics management. Discovering the transformative effects of industry 4.0 on supply chain management by reading on, however, SCM practices, this study considers the questioner-based data from September 2021 to March 2022 for China economy. Interestingly, the findings of structural equation model (SEM) describe the supportive response of revolution (the fourth industrial revolution) to supply chain management in the previously described field. The consequences of this research argue that the supportive role of technological progress in industrial revolution brings efficient supply chain management. Moreover, the performance indicators under the supply chain work well due to significant progress in industry 4.0. In concluding remarks, such types of advanced technologies serve as an intermediate between the management and practices of supply chain. However, the results provide light on the basic principles behind the success. In addition, these technologies make it possible to significantly improve the performance by allowing process unification, mechanization, and automation and introducing innovative analytic capabilities and supply chain operations including procurement, production, and inventory management, and marketing may work together more efficiently. Some of these processes include marketing, inventory management, and procurement. These improvements are attainable through the implementation of innovative scientific capabilities.},

While studies have continued to show a persistent western hegemony in published scholarship, research has largely focused on the most prestigious journals in the field, and it remains unclear how journals from beyond the most elite contribute to geographic diversity. This study makes a unique contribution to the existing knowledge body, through comparative analysis of the internationality (as a product of editorial boards, published authors, authorship compositions, and study contexts) of higher education journals in both the highest quartile of impact (Q1) and the lowest quartile of impact (Q4). The results show that while some journals may orient themselves as international in scope, in practice they may be more concentrated in particular regions. Although Q-ranking was not found to be a clear indicator of geographic diversity, Q4 journals are statistically more likely to include research and researchers from outside of the core anglophone countries, making an important contribution to the diversity of scholarship beyond the dominating western and English-language discourse.},

The key algorithms for the developed robot system are: object detection using a computer vision system; object grasping; trajectory planning with collision avoidance; and operator interaction using a force/torque sensor. All these algorithms have been experimentally tested in the laboratory to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.},

Explainable artificial intelligence can be a viable solution to mitigate this problem. This paper proposes a research model to address how explainable artificial intelligence can impact decision-making processes. Using an experimental design, empirical data is collected to test the research model. This paper is one of the pioneer papers providing empirical evidence about the impact of explainable artificial intelligence on supply chain decision-making processes. We propose a serial mediation path, which includes transparency and agile decision-making. Findings reveal that explainable artificial intelligence enhances transparency, thereby significantly contributing to agile decision-making for improving cyber resilience during supply chain cyberattacks. Moreover, we conduct a post hoc analysis using text analysis to explore the themes present in tweets discussing explainable artificial intelligence in decision support systems. The results indicate a predominantly positive attitude towards explainable artificial intelligence within these systems. Furthermore, the text analysis reveals two main themes that emphasize the importance of transparency, explainability, and interpretability in explainable artificial intelligence.},

The traditional shoe industry has high manpower requirements but a low ratio of information personnel and high-Tech equipment. Many testing procedures can only be performed manually. The complexity of footwear products is high, and the entire inspection process depends on a large amount of manpower. Therefore, problems such as consuming too much manpower, lack of efficiency, difficulty in precise inspection, quality requirements that vary from person to person, and incomplete quality management are extended. Through traditional machine learning methods, most of them are supervised learning methods. Under this method, a large number of negative samples should be always collected. It is very difficult to collect these negative samples in actual industrial production. Therefore, this article proposes a defect detection model based on unsupervised learning. As long as there are enough positive samples to be trained, we use the BEGAN model to modify it and combine another Autoencoder. This model is much easier and faster to be trained than the traditional GAN model, better responding to the footwear industry with more product types.},

It is, however, difficult to extract design elements from a segmented image dataset. To address this challenge, we propose an ML-GNN model that segments plantar pressure images using metal-earning. The first part of the paper presents a method for extracting image features that reduce the complexity of the ML-GNN algorithm. To create the network structure, we propose optimization meta-based learning. Using a meta-learning-based graphic neural network, we enhance our mask-based CNN prediction model with VGG16 and CNN layers. We pre-processed the plantar pressure dataset using pressure-sensing data acquisition and compared the results. By defining standard image segmentation indices, we demonstrate the high effectiveness of our research. We have developed an ML-GNN model that improves the segmentation accuracy of plantar pressure images and can also be applied to other sensor image datasets. Through our shoe-last customization approach, we enable the shoe industry to manufacture shoes more efficiently, particularly for people with specific healthcare needs who require bespoke shoe designs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of intelligent image segmentation to advance the field of footwear design and improve the lives of people with specific health requirements.},
