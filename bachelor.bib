   abstract = {The Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT), also known as ChatGPT, is a powerful generative AI model that can simulate human-like dialogues across a variety of domains. However, this popularity has attracted the attention of malicious actors who exploit ChatGPT to launch cyberattacks. This paper examines the tactics that adversaries use to leverage ChatGPT in a variety of cyberattacks. Attackers pose as regular users and manipulate ChatGPT’s vulnerability to malicious interactions, particularly in the context of cyber assault. The paper presents illustrative examples of cyberattacks that are possible with ChatGPT and discusses the realm of ChatGPT-fueled cybersecurity threats. The paper also investigates the extent of user awareness of the relationship between ChatGPT and cyberattacks. A survey of 253 participants was conducted, and their responses were measured on a three-point Likert scale. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of how ChatGPT can be used to improve business processes and identify areas for improvement. Over 80% of the participants agreed that cyber criminals use ChatGPT for malicious purposes. This finding underscores the importance of improving the security of this novel model. Organizations must take steps to protect their computational infrastructure. This analysis also highlights opportunities for streamlining processes, improving service quality, and increasing efficiency. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for using ChatGPT in a secure manner, outlining ways to mitigate potential cyberattacks and strengthen defenses against adversaries.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, business processes are increasingly supported by IT services that produce massive amounts of event data during the execution of a process. These event data can be used to analyze the process using process mining techniques to discover the real process, measure conformance to a given process model, or to enhance existing models with performance information. Mapping the produced events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process mining results. In order to accomplish this mapping with low manual effort, we developed a semi-automatic approach that maps events to activities using insights from behavioral analysis and label analysis. The approach extracts Declare constraints from both the log and the model to build matching constraints to efficiently reduce the number of possible mappings. These mappings are further reduced using techniques from natural language processing, which allow for a matching based on labels and external knowledge sources. The evaluation with synthetic and real-life data demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach and its robustness toward non-conforming execution logs.},

As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human–AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform-based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well-being.},

   abstract = {Requirements Elicitation (RE) is focused on identifying and characterizing the stakeholders and their requirements. Such an activity may be challenging as the scope of the software product domain grows, generating errors and delays. Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with automatically analyzing, understanding, and generating natural language. Software analysts use NLP-based approaches for improving RE, making it more efficient and reliable. However, domain scope and limitation for understanding the writing styles of requirements documents generate significant drawbacks for such approaches. In this Ph.D. Thesis we propose SQUARE (Scalable QUestion Answering for Requirements Elicitation), a novel approach for improving the NLP-based approaches for RE based on Question Answering Systems (QASs), comprising a meta-restricted domain for RE and a rule-based approach for generating RE-related questions and answers. QASs are used for extracting precise and concise answers to natural language questions. The SQUARE model represents a contribution for the NLP-based approaches for RE, allowing software analysts for identifying, extracting, and structuring key abstractions from requirements documents such as actors, actions, and concepts in a more natural way due to its proximity to a real-life RE domain. We validate our proposal by using an experimental process. The SQUARE model is included as a new work product for eliciting requirements. Therefore, the SQUARE model is intended to be an NLP-based approach to RE for software analysts.},

We then survey the historical development of NLP, spanning over five decades, in terms of three waves. The first two waves arose as rationalism and empiricism, paving ways to the current deep learning wave. The key pillars underlying the deep learning revolution for NLP consist of (1) distributed representations of linguistic entities via embedding, (2) semantic generalization due to the embedding, (3) long-span deep sequence modeling of natural language, (4) hierarchical networks effective for representing linguistic levels from low to high, and (5) end-to-end deep learning methods to jointly solve many NLP tasks. After the survey, several key limitations of current deep learning technology for NLP are analyzed. This analysis leads to five research directions for future advances in NLP.},

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.},

Design/methodology/approach - A method is proposed based on combining several semantic technologies. The research follows a design-science-oriented approach in that a method together with its supporting artifacts has been engineered. It application allows for reusing legacy models and automatedly determining semantic similarity. Findings - The method has been applied and the first findings suggest the effectiveness of the approach. The results of applying the method show its feasibility and significance. The suggested heuristic computing of semantic correspondences between semantically heterogeneous business process models is flexible and can support domain users. Research limitations/implications - Even though a solution can be offered that is directly usable, so far the full complexity of the natural language as given in model element labels is not yet completely resolvable. Here further research could contribute to the potential optimizations and refinement of automatic matching and linguistic procedures. However, an open research question could be solved.

   abstract = {The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the business sector has led to a new era of digital transformation. AI is transforming processes, functions, and practices throughout organizations creating system and process efficiencies, performing advanced data analysis, and contributing to the value creation process of the organization. However, the implementation and adoption of AI systems in the organization is not without challenges, ranging from technical issues to human-related barriers, leading to failed AI transformation efforts or lower than expected gains. We argue that while engineers and data scientists excel in handling AI and data-related tasks, they often lack insights into the nuanced human aspects critical for organizational AI success. Thus, Human Resource Management (HRM) emerges as a crucial facilitator, ensuring AI implementation and adoption are aligned with human values and organizational goals. This paper explores the critical role of HRM in harmonizing AI's technological capabilities with human-centric needs within organizations while achieving business objectives. Our positioning paper delves into HRM's multifaceted potential to contribute toward AI organizational success, including enabling digital transformation, humanizing AI usage decisions, providing strategic foresight regarding AI, and facilitating AI adoption by addressing concerns related to fears, ethics, and employee well-being. It reviews key considerations and best practices for operationalizing human-centric AI through culture, leadership, knowledge, policies, and tools. By focusing on what HRM can realistically achieve today, we emphasize its role in reshaping roles, advancing skill sets, and curating workplace dynamics to accommodate human-centric AI implementation. This repositioning involves an active HRM role in ensuring that the aspirations, rights, and needs of individuals are integral to the economic, social, and environmental policies within the organization. This study not only fills a critical gap in existing research but also provides a roadmap for organizations seeking to improve AI implementation and adoption and humanizing their digital transformation journey.},

This paper explores the emergence of hyperautomation as a transformative force in organizations. Following an introduction defining hyperautomation and its enabling technologies, the paper outlines key benefits including accelerated workflows, expanded capacity through digital workers, and enhanced decision-making from AI. Case studies showcase leading companies using hyperautomation to increase efficiency, lower costs, and improve customer experiences. An analysis quantifies the business value generated, with one firm achieving a 92% reduction in processing time. Guidance is then provided for implementing hyperautomation aligned to strategic goals, choosing complementary technologies, integrating with existing systems, and navigating potential hurdles. With projections of over 55% annual growth, hyperautomation adoption is rapidly accelerating across industries. While promising more efficient operations, hyperautomation also raises important ethical questions around security, transparency, and job displacement requiring thoughtful consideration. This research synthesizes current trends, examples, and expert insights to provide a comprehensive look at the rise of hyperautomation and its implications. The paper concludes that hyperautomation represents a new frontier for business process automation, fundamentally changing how organizations operate, interact, and make decisions.

As the competitiveness between supply chains intensifies day by day, companies are shifting their focus to predictive analytics techniques to minimize costs and boost productivity and profits. Excessive inventory (overstock) and stock outs are very significant issues for suppliers. Excessive inventory levels can lead to loss of revenue because the company's capital is tied up in excess inventory. Excess inventory can also lead to increased storage, insurance costs and labor as well as lower and degraded quality based on the nature of the product. Shortages or out of stock can lead to lost sales and a decline in customer contentment and loyalty to the store. If clients are unable to find the right products on the shelves, they may switch to another vendor or purchase alternative items. Demand forecasting is valuable for planning, scheduling and improving the coordination of all supply chain activities. This paper discusses the use of neural networks for seasonal time series forecasting. Our objective is to evaluate the contribution of the correct choice of the transfer function by proposing a new form of the transfer function to improve the quality of the forecast.},

   abstract = {Chatbots enable organizations in the business-to-customer domain to respond to repetitive requests efficiently. Extant approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) already address the essential requirement of understanding user input and synthesizing a response as close as possible to a response a human interlocutor would give. However, we argue that the organizational adoption of chatbots further depends on the underlying model's capability to learn and comply with organizations’ business processes, for example, authenticating a customer before providing sensitive details. To address this issue, we develop an approach that quantifies chatbots’ ability to learn business processes using standardized process mining metrics. We demonstrate our approach by training chatbots on a dataset of more than 500,000 customer service conversations from three companies on Twitter and show how our approach supports the quantification of a chatbot's overall ability to learn business processes from the training data. Furthermore, we quantify a chatbot's ability to learn a particular variant of the underlying process and we show how to compare the chatbot's executed steps against a given normative process model. Our approach that seamlessly integrates with existing approaches to evaluate NLP-based chatbots mitigates the current hurdles that practitioners face and, therefore, strives to foster the adoption of chatbots in practice.},

   abstract = {Predictive process monitoring (PPM) allows companies to improve the efficiency of their business processes by predicting aspects such as the process outcome, the next event, or the time until the next event. So far, existing studies have mainly focused on developing novel predictive models while using features solely from event logs. In this study, we aim to go beyond log data and increase the focus of PPM research towards external context information. To this end, we consider digital documents as they are omnipresent in many business processes and their inclusion can often be justified by a business rationale. However, incorporating digital documents into PPM models poses considerable challenges as they present unstructured data that can contain visual and textual cues of future process behavior, while manual feature extraction is generally not feasible. Therefore, we propose an approach that processes digital documents based on automated visual and textual feature extraction methods. Furthermore, we design a tailored integration module which transforms the extracted features from multiple document pages into a fixed-size representation that subsequently serves as input for the predictive models. Our evaluation, based on a real-world dataset of insurance claims from a mid-sized German insurance company, featuring 5131 process instances with 32,058 events and 39,242 document pages, shows that incorporating digital documents improves the performance by significant margins in predicting the damage type, the next event, and the time until the next event. Finally, we analyze how digital documents contribute to the model's predictions in terms of Shapley additive explanations.},

This article attempts to examine whether and how digital transformation affects total factor productivity (TFP) at the firm-level. Using 2913 listed companies in China from 2012 to 2018, this study finds that digital transformation is positively associated with corporate TFP in China. Our explanatory variable of firm-level digitalization index is constructed via text analysis methods. After a series of robustness checks and different attempts that mitigate endogeneity concerns, our findings remain valid. However, traditional information and communication technologies (ICT) cannot improve corporate TFP. Further analyses of three plausible channels indicate that digital technologies improve TFP primarily through cost reduction and human substitution rather than supervision advantage. The results indicate that firms achieve actual benefits from the digital transformation, and how digital transformation improve the sustainable development. This study could serve as a policy inspiration for other developing countries.},

This paper focuses on the macroeconomic perspective, reviewing recent literature in order to answer three key questions. First, what approaches are being used to represent AI in economic models? Second, will AI technology have an impact on the economy different from that of previous new technologies? Third, in which aspects will AI have an impact, and what is the empirical evidence for these effects of AI?. On the first question, our review reveals that the incorporation of AI into economic models raises fundamental questions on economics and economic models. On the second question, while most empirical studies cannot deny the existence of the Solow Paradox for AI technology, some studies find that AI would have a different and broader impact than previous technologies. On the third question, studies on the labor market seem to suggest a stylized fact regarding the impact of AI on employment on different levels, and income inequality across skill levels and between developing and developed countries. The impacts of AI on international trade and education have been largely neglected and are worth further research in the future. It is also important for both theoretical and empirical studies to have a clear and accurate definition of AI so that the results are not misinterpreted.},
